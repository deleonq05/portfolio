<h2>You don't matter</h2>

<p> <span class="card">You don't matter. The truth behind those words rationalizes the embodiment of absurdism. 
The world is a big place that houses a lot of pain, happiness, confusion, and love. 
These occurrences equate to essentially nothing in purpose. We go through cycles of life and happenings but why? Why does it happen? 
<br></br>

Well, it doesn't matter. There is no purpose in finding out because there is none to find. I often hear people say, "Why did this happen to me?"
when in reality, the answer is impertinent and inconsequential. There is no reason why a certain thing happens to you because the world, the universe, 
does not have a parti pris on you. Absurdism is an interesting response to life's harsh unknowns. Not to be confused with Nihilism,
which shares similar sentiments, but passive nihilism responds to the intrinsic meaningless of life in a different way than absurdism does. 
For passive nihilism, it is quite pointless to make meaning into life, but absurdists make it a point to accept the pointlessness and just be happy.
Embracing the absurd and letting the world spin despite the hollowness of the world. 

<br></br>

The fictitious entity that will be leading this philosophy will be the 11th Tower. 
The 11th Tower is a community that testifies to the efficacy in the acceptance of not mattering in the world. 
The 11th Tower believes in chaos and renewal, therefore rewarding the meaningless of life with quality of life. 
If nothing matters, then do whatever you want! Create that YouTube channel you've been wanting to, eat that burger, jaywalk, 
jump off a bridge, do whatever. It doesn't matter. You don't matter, and no one certainly thinks you do! And maybe that's why it would make living life 
special because you're able to do whatever you want. There's no meaning or purpose, meaning that life is just whatever you make of it. 
Albert Camus presented us with three responses to pick from to respond to the inconsequential lives we have: Philosophical suicide, physical suicide, and acceptance. 
Of course, people are free to do whatever they want within these responses, but the 11th Tower urges acceptance, grasp that insanity with two hands, and make something of it. 
There can still be good things amidst the nonsensical value or purpose that we all carry. 

<br></br>

This project delves deep into discovering yourself and understanding the constant unknowns that life continually projects at you. It's almost a motivational scheme as it aids 
people to accept the chaos and still carry on. Even though at its surface, it's brash and comes off as harsh, the 11th Tower's premise is to uplift people to be their happiest 
version as best as they can. As Albert Camus mentions Sisyphus&#151;a Greek mythological man who is punished to roll a rock up a hill for eternity&#151;as a metaphor, that regardless 
of what the ball we've been given to continuously roll for the end of our lives, we must do it somewhat happily. It doesn't necessarily mean that we have to be constantly suffering at all times and suffer happily. 
It just means that the only way out is through; if you're stuck in a hellhole, why not keep on going and look forward to getting out of it? We have been buried with limitations from the start, 
and it's a line some people refuse to cross. Instead of continuing to limit ourselves, we should urge each other to cross that line and do what makes us happy. In most cases, what people need is a simple push. 
This project could become a benevolent untruth that could "push" people in their rightful direction. </span> </p>
