      I was born and raised in the Philippines and now reside in Illinois. A curious, passionate individual, I am prone
      to adventurous projects! And like a moth to a fly, an uncovered skill hates to see me coming. I am a constant
      learner and a forever student.

      I think of myself as a forever student because I feel as if there's something to learn from someone and somewhere
      at all times. When I was working as a Social Media Assistant at the College of DuPage, I was told to soak in my
      surroundings like a sponge. And I apply that in every work or school environment that I attend. Being stagnant and
      refusing to change is a routine that I avoid.

    <p class="biop2">Facts about me:

      1. I'm bilingual! I can speak Tagalog and
      English fluently.
      2. I love watching movies! Even though it's a different art form from UX/UX and Marketing, I find that there are
      similarities in components like storytelling and cinematography. Movies have to have a way to intrigue people with
      words and imagery. It's a good way to find inspiration.
      3. I collect vintage cameras and CDs. My mom and my wallet have told me to stop, but I really can't.</p>
