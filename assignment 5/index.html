	  <p>There's never a doubt in my mind that when the sun shines, my eyelashes will flutter open and 
		I'll heave a sigh for another day. It's an innate need&mdash;to feel the sun through your bones. 
		To bare yourself open, sternum facing upwards, nose tipped high, eyes closed. 
		It feels good. The heat, the constant intensity, it feels immensely addictive. 
		Only when I feel the sweat drip down to my forehead, do I ever wonder if it's too much.
		Sometimes, I think it's a curse. To love something that you can't touch. I crave summer days, ice-cream dripping on the 
		concrete floor, and the cicadas humming their songs. But the sun doesn't revolve around me. It will 
		continue to come up and down, whether I get up or not. I need the sun, but it doesn't need me. 
		There's distance between us. I need it, I plead with it, but I can never look at it for too long. 
		It's a curse to care this much.
