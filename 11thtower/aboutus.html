			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>The 11th Tower is a community that testifies to the efficacy in the acceptance of not mattering in the
				world. The 11th Tower believes in chaos and renewal, therefore rewarding the meaningless of life with
				quality of life. The 11th Tower welcomes people who are like-minded individuals who strive to do
				whatever they want in this meaningless life. You don't matter, and no one certainly thinks you do! And
				maybe that's why it would make living life special because you're able to do whatever you want. There's
				no meaning or purpose, meaning that life is just whatever you make of it. As we navigate the
				complexities of life, we invite you to join our community, where we explore the richness of existence
				and the beauty of our shared experiences. In a world often devoid of inherent meaning, we find strength
				in embracing the unpredictable and celebrating the journey itself. Instead of seeking elusive answers,
				we focus on the joy of living, finding significance in each moment.</p>

			<h1>Why us?</h1>
			<p>As Albert Camus mentions Sisyphus—a Greek mythological man who is punished to roll a rock up a hill for
				eternity—as a metaphor, that regardless of what the ball we've been given to continuously roll for the
				end of our lives, we must do it somewhat happily. It doesn't necessarily mean that we have to be
				constantly suffering at all times and suffer happily. It just means that the only way out is through; if
				you're stuck in a hellhole, why not keep on going and look forward to getting out of it? We have been
				buried with limitations from the start, and it's a line some people refuse to cross. Instead of
				continuing to limit ourselves, we should urge each other to cross that line and do what makes us happy. Join our cause and be enlightened
				in what's out in this uncaring world.
