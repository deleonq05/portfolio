			<p id="onep" class="reveal" div class="fade-text">There's this place called Tagaytay. It's a city
				in the province of Cavite in the Philippines. Through a number of viewpoint sites located across the
				city, Tagaytay offers views of Taal Volcano Island in the center of Taal Lake in Batangas. In reference
				to the Tagaytay Ridge, where the city is located, the Tagalog terms tagaytay or taytay, which mean
				"mountain ridge" or "low mountain range," are the source of the name Tagaytay. It's beautiful, it really
				is. It's one of the places in the Philippines where you can find a lighter breeze and many shades from
				the
				unrelentless, beating sun. It's a sanctuary for me and my family.

			<p id="twop" class="reveal" div class="fade-text">I dream of it some days. When I'm deep in sleep, tucked away in my bed, I often feel the sense
				of light
				precipitation. Light droplets falling around me, lulling me deeper into sleep. I dream of sweet
				mangosteen
				and ripe mangoes, my finger stained and sticky with the juices. I can just hear my mom next to me,
				telling me
				what differentiates good fruit to bad fruit. I still vex her with the same response, "Mom, I don't
				understand the difference."
				Even in sleep I can imagine the smell, my brain tells me it smells like car exhaust and grilled chicken
				intenstines. It
				smells like pool chlorine and freshly cut grass. My hand feels the grasp of family members, their
				calloused hands grips mine.
				I don't want to let go, but I do. When I wake up, I crave of sweet fruits and long for mountains sights.
