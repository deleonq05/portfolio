      There are things that just go well with each other. Peanut butter and jelly, your bed and your pillow, and many
      more. But design and AI is something that weighs on a lot of people's minds. And for a good reason, there are a
      lot of art that are being currently replicated by AI and User Experience is not an exception to their iteration.
      In Design is Dead by Michael F. Buckley, the topic of AI being side by side with design is explored. The idea that
      User Experience and design skills are becoming obsolete is prominent in Buckley's article. But the main idea is
      that your artwork is not losing to AI, but someone who knows AI better than you. But what is User Experience? User
      Experience Design, or UX Design, encompasses all elements of something as perceived by users, including a website,
      landing page, their own identity, and the service itself. There is UX design everywhere. It is integrated into
      everything you use, including websites and apps, automobile console controls, and even the grip on kitchen
      appliances like can openers. There are also more specific uses for UX design, such as in medical gadgets and
      surgical instruments. To put it briefly, when UX design is done right, it can help launch better products with a
      higher chance of success. Businesses that incorporate a well-considered UX design strategy into their product
      development processes not only improve the end user's experience but also increase profits and reduce liability. </p>

     <p> On the other hand, The term artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a group of technologies that enable computers
      to carry out operations that normally call for human intelligence. AI systems are capable of learning,
      problem-solving, and decision-making. There are pros and cons in using artificial intelligence. Artificial
      intelligence (AI) has been a game-changer in many industries, offering a ton of benefits, but also raising some
      concerns. One of the major pros is efficiency. AI can handle repetitive tasks and process large amounts of data
      much faster than us. This has been helpful in fields like healthcare, where AI helps in customer service, where
      chatbots can assist customers at any time of day. AI also allows for more personalization in things like shopping
      and content recommendations, making our lives more convenient. On the flip side, one of the biggest downsides is
      the fear of job displacement. As AI becomes more capable, there's a real concern that it could replace jobs in
      sectors like manufacturing, transportation, and most especially in creative fields. Plus, there's the issue of
      privacy. AI systems often rely on massive amounts of data, which can raise questions about how our personal
      information is being used or misused. There's also the worry of AI making decisions that we don't fully understand
      or can't control, like in the case of autonomous vehicles or algorithms that affect hiring practices. </p>

     <p> As a UX designer, I have a lot of mixed feelings about AI creeping into the design space. Sure, it's a good tool
      to speed up certain tasks, like automating user testing or analyzing data to find trends, but I'm not fully sold
      on the idea of AI being the end result of a design project. The creative side of design involves empathy,
      understanding nuanced human behavior, and making decisions based on subtle feedback from real users—things that,
      honestly, I don't think AI can fully replicate. It can generate layouts or suggest color schemes based on
      algorithms, but that doesn't mean it's capturing the essence of what a user truly feels when interacting with a
      product. I mean, sure, AI can be a helpful assistant, but can it truly replace the instinct and understanding that
      comes from working closely with real people? AI should remain a tool—like an extra set of hands for
      data crunching or repetitive tasks—rather than taking over the actual design process. If we let AI dictate the
      outcome, it might create designs that look nice on paper but miss the mark on connecting with users on a deeper
      level. At the end of the day, design is about humans designing for humans, and I'm not convinced that AI can
      replace that heart of the process.
