					<h1>Albert Camus</h1>

				<p>"The subject of this essay is precisely this relationship between
					the absurd and suicide, the exact degree to which suicide is a
					solution to the absurd. The principle can be established that for a
					man who does not cheat, what he believes to be true must
					determine his action. Belief in the absurdity of existence must then
					dictate his conduct. It is legitimate to wonder, clearly and without
					false pathos, whether a conclusion of this importance requires
					forsaking as rapidly as possible an incomprehensible condition. I
					am speaking, of course, of men inclined to be in harmony with
					themselves."</p>

				<p>"Stated clearly, this problem may seem both simple and
					insoluble. But it is wrongly assumed that simple questions involve
					answers that are no less simple and that evidence implies evidence.
					A priori and reversing the terms of the problem, just as one does or
					does not kill oneself, it seems that there are but two philosophical
					solutions, either yes or no. This would be too easy. But allowance
					must be made for those who, without concluding, continue
					questioning. Here I am only slightly indulging in irony: this is the
					majority. I notice also that those who answer “no” act as if they
					thought “yes.” As a matter of fact, if I accept the Nietzschean
					criterion, they think “yes” in one way or another. On the other
					hand, it often happens that those who commit suicide were assured
					of the meaning of life. These contradictions are constant. It may
					even be said that they have never been so keen as on this point
					where, on the contrary, logic seems so desirable. It is a
					commonplace to compare philosophical theories and the behavior
					of those who profess them. But it must be said that of the thinkers
					who refused a meaning to life none except Kirilov who belongs to
					literature, Peregrinos who is born of legend, and Jules Lequier
					who belongs to hypothesis, admitted his logic to the point of
					refusing that life. Schopenhauer is often cited, as a fit subject for
					laughter, because he praised suicide while seated at a well-set
					table. This is no subject for joking. That way of not taking the
					tragic seriously is not so grievous, but it helps to judge a man."</p>

					<h1>Response</h1>

				</header>

				<p>The link between seemingly straightforward philosophical concerns and their significant ramifications
					is intricately
					explored in this paragraphs from "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus. It draws attention to the
					fallacy that
					simple questions have equally simple answers, especially when it comes to suicide and the meaning of
					life. The
					author contends that although many people may appear to support or refute the meaning of life, their
					actions and
					beliefs reveal a deeper irony. People who believe that existence has no purpose frequently act in
					ways that betray
					their beliefs, exposing a complex web of lived experience and intellectual ideas.</p>

				<p>AThe book also criticizes prominent intellectuals who struggle with similar existential issues. Few
					people, as demonstrated by individuals like Schopenhauer, who advocated nuanced opinions on suicide
					while appearing indifferent to its seriousness, have continuously rejected life's significance
					without contradiction. This conflict between philosophical ideas and individual beliefs encourages
					contemplation of the ways in which existence theories relate to the human predicament. The chapter
					concludes by highlighting the complex relationships between belief, inquiry, and the pursuit of
					meaning, implying that the desire for knowledge is an essential part of human existence in and of
					itself.</p>
