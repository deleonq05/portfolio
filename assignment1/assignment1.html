<p> Kate Wagner's 404 Page Not Found article divulges the thought of nostalgia and web consequences. 
Wagner did a wonderful job explaining the result of growing up with the internet. 
It's simultaneously a ride of your life as well as the greatest hellish impending doom. I have a love-hate relationship with the internet, as one usually does. 
I feel that it has contributed to educating me about movements, and news, and understanding others' perspectives. But I also feel like it has impaired my brain on a molecular level that cannot be fixed. 
I feel like I was exposed to a lot of content that I should have not been exposed to at such a young age, and that probably also took years out of my life. 
When I say love-hate relationship, I really mean it. I've talked to my therapist about social media before; it is that serious. </p>

<p> But something that piqued my interest in Wagner's article is the idea of hidden philosophies on the internet or the deletion of it at least. In the section of "The Hell of Beautiful Interfaces" Wagner states,  
"The reason the tech literati don't wring their hands more is obvious: the artifacts of internet life are personal&#151;that is, not professionally or historically notable&#151;and therefore worthless."
I am a big fan of learning about lost media, most especially the ones that are on the internet. What I sympathize with the most is that most of these Geocities or lost media on the internet stem from neglect. 
Not neglect from its creators, which sometimes can be the case, but neglect with the changing times. I didn't know about Geocities until I read Wagner's article, and it saddens me to think that people were able to freely express themselves by creating their websites, 
which were born from pure interests, but losing to Web 2.0's clinical aesthetic. I couldn't even believe that there was a time when it was free and easily accessible to create websites for whatever content your heart ever so desired.
I feel like that ability has been lost to commercial corporations. The idea that the personal oeuvre of people in the late 90s and early 2000s was forgotten by the simple fact that they were non-profitable is a sad thought, and it ultimately always comes down to money. </p>

<p>It feels like everything has been gatekept, something that was so universally accessible is now something that needs to be borrowed from corporations, and not just that, but they can't personalize it as much as they can. 
It makes me think about what Wagner says about social media like Instagram and Facebook where you can't personalize or stylize it. It's the same interface for everything nowadays, and that's exactly what brings out the nostalgia. </p>

<p>Wagner talks about how sterile, postmodernism internet has changed us, "What is not so obvious is the way Instagram recycles the original aesthetics, indeed the political ethos, that arose from vaporwave and even the early internet itself, 
into a decontextualized set of images: the internet has become nostalgia in search of a platform." Users are exhausted of commercial sites and long for the creativity and the unexpectedness that Web 1.0 had, or at least I do. 
There's nothing that excites me on the internet anymore because it's all filled with bleak dashboards and impersonal sites. And when I say bleak and impersonal, I don't necessarily find personalities on the internet anymore, mostly on commercial sites. 
There are not a lot of personal sites left because not a lot of people deem it worthy anymore because there's no money that comes out of it, even if it's at the cost of finding people alike, building communities, and creating a haven. The nostalgia runs deep, 
but I don't see changes coming in the foreseeable future, as I feel like we're immobile in an internet limbo. We're so deep in Web 2.0 and now Web 3.0 that it's hard to just dismantle thoughts and ideas that have been embedded in our minds. 
But with one step at a time, differences in the internet and media can be made. </p>
